  <p class="text-muted">
    Church is an ecclesiological term referring to what different Christian denominations conceive of as being the true body of Christians or the original institution established by Jesus.[1][2][3] "Christian Church" has also been used in academia as a synonym for Christianity.[4][5][6]

For many Protestant Christians, the Christian Church has two components: the church visible, institutions in which "the Word of God purely preached and listened to, and the sacraments administered according to Christ's institution", as well as the church invisible—all "who are truly saved" (with these beings members of the visible church).[7][2][8] In this understanding of the invisible church, "Christian Church" (or catholic Church) does not refer to a particular Christian denomination, but includes all individuals who have been regenerated.[2] The branch theory, which is maintained by some Anglicans, holds that those Churches that have preserved apostolic succession are part of the true Church.[9] This is in contrast to the one true church applied to a specific concrete Christian institution, a Christian ecclesiological position maintained by the Catholic Church, the Eastern Orthodox Church, the Oriental Orthodox churches, Assyrian Church of the East and the Ancient Church of the East.[1][10][3]

Most English translations of the New Testament generally use the word church as a translation of the Ancient Greek: ἐκκλησία, romanized: ecclesia, found in the original Greek texts, which generally meant an "assembly" or "congregation".[11] This term appears in two verses of the Gospel of Matthew, 24 verses of the Acts of the Apostles, 58 verses of the Pauline epistles (including the earliest instances of its use in relation to a Christian body), two verses of the Letter to the Hebrews, one verse of the Epistle of James, three verses of the Third Epistle of John, and 19 verses of the Book of Revelation. In total, ἐκκλησία appears in the New Testament text 114 times, although not every instance is a technical reference to the church.[12] As such it is used for local communities as well as in a universal sense to mean all believers.[13] The earliest recorded use of the term Christianity (Greek: Χριστιανισμός) was by Ignatius of Antioch, in around 100 AD.[14]

<h4 class="text-cpitalize"> <kbd> </kbd> school library </h4>
<hr>
<h5 class="text-capitalize text-success"> was build in 1980 </h5>
<p class="text-muted"> A library is a collection of materials, books or media that are easily accessible for use and not just for display purposes. It is responsible for housing updated information in order to meet the user's needs on a daily basis. A library provides physical (hard copies documents) or digital access (soft copies) materials, and may be a physical location or a virtual space, or both. A library's collection can include printed materials and other physical resources in many formats such as DVD, CD and Cassette as well as access to information, music or other content held on bibliographic databases.

  A library, which may vary widely in size, may be organized for use and maintained by a public body such as a government; an institution such as a school or museum; a corporation; or a private individual. In addition to providing materials, libraries also provide the services of librarians who are trained and experts at finding, selecting, circulating and organizing information and at interpreting information needs, navigating and analyzing very large amounts of information with a variety of resources.
  
  Library buildings often provide quiet and conducive areas for studying, as well as common areas for group study and collaboration, and may provide public facilities for access to their electronic resources; for instance: computers and access to the Internet. The library's clientele and therefore the services offered vary depending on its type: users of a public library have different needs from those of a special library, for example. Libraries may also be community hubs, where programs are delivered and people engage in lifelong learning. Modern libraries extend their services beyond the physical walls of a building by providing material accessible by electronic means, including from home via the Internet. Hence managing information in an information world has become very easy simply because information can be provided or being accessed virtually by people who are in remote areas and other places away from the library.</p>

<p class="text-muted"> An auditorium is a room built to enable an audience to hear and watch performances. For movie theatres, the number of auditoria (or auditoriums) is expressed as the number of screens. Auditoria can be found in entertainment venues, community halls, and theaters, and may be used for rehearsal, presentation, performing arts productions, or as a learning space.</p>

    Pollution is the presence of harmful substances in the environment. These harmful substances are called pollutants. There are various types of pollution that are Air Pollution, Water Pollution, Noise pollution and more. Because of the increase in population, pollution is also increasing on a daily basis. People are getting hazardous diseases with the increased level of pollution. Hence, everyone should be aware of the pollution, its effects and how to reduce it effectively.

  Football is one of the most popular games in the world. It is also one of the oldest games. It is a game of strength and stamina. In terms of popularity, it is as popular as cricket. Comparatively, it is more popular in Europe and Latin America.

Last Sunday, I got an opportunity to witness a football match which was played between Khalsa Modern School and Central School, Nawagaon. The match was played at the playgrounds of Government Boys’ Higher Secondary School, Navinagan, and Nawagaon. The entire ground was well decorated and a large number of chairs were arranged for the guests and spectators. Both the teams were well-prepared and confident of their win. The ground was full packed. The match was to start at 1 p.m. Both the teams entered the ground on scheduled time. After the toss, the referee blew the whistle and the match began. It was expected to be a well-contested and lively match. Both the teams were expecting to score well. During the first few minutes, it was the Khalsa Modern School who dominated the match. They struck hard to the defenses of their rival, but failed to score any goal. However, they performed brilliantly and the spectators enjoyed the game.

  There are various great science project ideas. Making us come up with intriguing and curious science project ideas on ourselves is probably one of the best ways. As a result of such encouragement, the task of coming up with good ideas can offer loads of as well as a great learning. Most school children are extremely curious and highly energetic and making them come up with an exciting science project idea will definitely make their attention to be focused on it.

  As schoolchildren, always we have a lot of questions to ask about a variety of things. With the intention of expanding our knowledge, diverse, unique, and brilliant questions sometimes spring from like those children. There’s a good chance that one of those questions could be transformed into an excellent science project idea.
  
  Normally, for a successful and exciting science project, requirements are a question, a hypothesis, and a conclusion. Some exciting and brilliant examples of past ideas include the examination of worms’ reaction to light, the ability of plants to grow under the influence of other liquids except water, and examining the preference of birds to several types of materials like wood and plastic to build their nests. Moreover, other exciting and brilliant science project ideas of school children include the examination of the power of magnets through materials like felt paper and newspapers and experimenting with the ability of ants to find their anthill if they were located some distance away from it.
